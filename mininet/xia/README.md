**This folder contains the XIA topology scripts and the XIA extension of Mininet modules**


*Important:* In order to start the topology a prerequisite is to have [Linux-XIA](https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux) installed.


You will find the installation steps for Linux-XIA [over here](https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux/wiki/How-to-install)

After completing the installation you are ready to have the topology started. Run the python script xia.py as root user.
 
```shell 
  $ sudo python xia.py
```
 You can use the respective xia commands to check if the configurations are done but in the same old mininet way. 


**An example command**
```shell 
  mininet> xia1 xip hid showaddrs
```
